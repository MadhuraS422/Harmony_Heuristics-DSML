Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning---Bach-Choral-Harmony

Bach's choral harmony refers to the unique style and approach to harmony found in the choral works of Johann Sebastian Bach, one of the most renowned composers of the Baroque period. 
Bach's choral harmonies are characterized by their complexity, richness, and expressive depth.
I had a simple study of these coral harmonics using Data Science and Machine Learning (DSML) Algorithms to build a classifier for prediction of coral harmony.
Choral harmony refers to the combination of different musical pitches, tones, and voices in choral music to create a pleasing and cohesive sound.
Python libraries like as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn are utilized in the project.

The process entails dividing the data into several subsets, using one subset to train the model, and using the other subset to assess the model's performance. 
For Cross-Validation, the train_test_split method is accordingly employed. An algorithmic prediction method called the Neighbors Classifier is applied to assist in forecasting the system's output values. 
Furthermore, one of the key variables in determining the dataset's prediction rate is the accuracy score. The accuracy score on prediction is 0.7353563867325336. 
The relationship between the predicted and actual values is scored for accuracy. 
As predicted, they should therefore fall between 0.7 and 0.9. Regarding HypeTuning the parameters for the dataset's input-output algorithm decision-making relationship. 





Overview:: It has been seen that the prediction rate for the Pitches and Meter verses the output rated Chord Label values the bruteâ€™s algorithm has been taken to the Accuracy Score of the 73.535% after Analyzing the dataset.
     The accuracy and correctness of harmonies performed by a chorus are assessed using the choral harmony accuracy score. 
     It evaluates the vocalists' ability to blend their tones, stay in tune, and keep the appropriate space between notes. 
     With a high accuracy score, the choir is able to produce a rich and well-balanced sound by expertly and cohesively executing harmonies. 
     On the other hand, a low accuracy score could indicate problems with sustaining a steady tone, synchronization between vocalists, or pitch errors. 
     A choral harmony accuracy score of 73.535% suggests that the choir demonstrates a moderate level of proficiency in executing harmonies. 
     While this score indicates that the choir generally performs well and achieves a cohesive sound, there is still room for improvement in certain areas.
     Possibly reaming 26.465% can be maintained on improving Pitch Accuracy, Timing issues, Tonal Balance, Expression and Dynamics, etc area.
